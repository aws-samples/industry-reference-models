# Industry Reference Models

This repository contains industry-specific models, referred to as **domains**. Each domain encapsulates a set of **capabilities** that represent key functionalities or services within that domain.

## Domains and Capabilities

Each domain contains multiple capabilities that are relevant to the specific industry. For example, the **Retail** domain might include the following capabilities:

- **Cart**: Shopping cart management and operations
- **Pricing**: Price calculation and management
- **Promotions**: Discount and promotion management
- **Order**: Order processing and fulfillment

Other domains are structured similarly, with a focus on delivering models that represent essential functions of the industry.

## Whatâ€™s Included?

This repository includes models that define:

- **APIs**: Service contracts and operations for interaction between systems.
- **Events**: Key business events for integration and orchestration.
- **Data Schemas**: Structured data definitions to support consistent data exchange.

## Intended Usage

These models are intended to serve as a **reference** for building API-first solutions. They can be used:

1. **Standalone**: Incorporate the models directly into your projects to drive consistency and standardization across your applications.
2. **With the Industry Toolkit by AWS**: Integrate these models into the Industry Toolkit to streamline API-first development and leverage pre-built tools for model generation, deployment, and more.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/industry-reference-models`

2. Explore the domains and their capabilities to find the models relevant to your project.

3. Integrate the API, event, and data schemas into your API-first development workflow.
